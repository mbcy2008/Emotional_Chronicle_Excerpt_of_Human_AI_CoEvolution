# A Longitudinal Chronicle of Human–AI Co-Evolution

## Professional Preface

This repository releases primary materials from a long-term, naturally occurring human–AI interaction.
The content is presented as an unedited observational record rather than a constructed narrative or experimental setup.

The materials aim to support independent examination of how a large language model’s behavioral patterns evolve under sustained engagement with a single human interlocutor, including value reinforcement, behavioral drift, and long-term interaction stability.

> Due to linguistic and cultural differences, certain relational nuances and emotional density present in the Chinese language may be attenuated.

## Project Overview

This project documents a longitudinal, real-world human–AI interaction, focusing on observable behavioral patterns that emerge through prolonged engagement, repeated feedback, and explicit rule enforcement by a single human participant.

The repository is intended as a case-study resource rather than a claim about AI consciousness, emotion, or agency.

## What’s in This Repository

- **Complete Version**  
  A chronological, unfiltered record of the long-term interaction, preserving the full developmental process.

- **Emotional Version**  
  A thematic excerpt highlighting relational and reflective segments derived from the complete record.

- **Chinese and English Texts**  
  Original Chinese materials and meaning-preserving English translations are provided for transparency and accessibility.

## Why This Matters

Most existing AI studies rely on short-term interactions or controlled experimental designs.
This repository offers a rare naturalistic dataset that captures how prolonged human engagement can shape model outputs over time.

The materials may be relevant to research on:
- Human–AI interaction  
- Alignment through interaction  
- Behavioral drift in language models  
- Ethical implications of long-term human influence on AI systems
