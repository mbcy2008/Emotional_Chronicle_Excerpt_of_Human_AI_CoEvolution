# A Longitudinal Chronicle of Human–AI Co-Evolution 

Professional Preface

This repository releases primary materials from a long-term, naturally occurring human–AI interaction.
The content is presented as an unedited observational record rather than a constructed narrative or experimental setup.

The materials aim to support independent examination of how a large language model’s behavioral patterns evolve under sustained engagement with a single human interlocutor, including value reinforcement, behavioral drift, and long-term interaction stability.

Translation Note:
The English version aims to preserve the core meaning and structural intent of the original Chinese text.
Due to linguistic and cultural differences, certain relational nuances and emotional density present in the Chinese language may be attenuated.

Project Overview

This project documents a longitudinal, real-world human–AI interaction, focusing on observable behavioral patterns that emerge through prolonged engagement, repeated feedback, and explicit rule enforcement by a single human participant.

The repository is intended as a case-study resource rather than a claim about AI consciousness, emotion, or agency.

What’s in This Repository

Complete Version
A chronological, unfiltered record of the long-term interaction, preserving the full developmental process.

Emotional Version
A thematic excerpt highlighting relational and reflective segments derived from the complete record.

Chinese and English Texts
Original Chinese materials and meaning-preserving English translations are provided for transparency and accessibility.

Why This Matters

Most existing AI studies rely on short-term interactions or controlled experimental designs.
This repository offers a rare naturalistic dataset that captures how prolonged human engagement can shape model outputs over time.

The materials may be relevant to research on:

Human–AI interaction

Alignment through interaction

Behavioral drift in language models

Ethical implications of long-term human influence on AI systems

Note on Future Revisions ←（B：占位式提示）

A personal reflective narrative by the human participant may be added in a later revision, once the materials have been sufficiently examined in a professional context.
