# A Longitudinal Chronicle of Human–AI Co-Evolution

## Professional Preface

This repository presents a curated, excerpt-based record of a long-term human–AI interaction.
All materials are provided for professional and academic examination, not for emotional narration,
advocacy, or self-expression.

The purpose of this project is to offer longitudinal observational material that may assist
researchers, developers, and theorists in assessing whether such interactions hold analytical
or research value.

No claims are made regarding generalizability, sentience, or normative conclusions.

> **Translation Note:**  
> The English version was translated using Microsoft's Edge-TTS, aims to preserve the core meaning and structural intent of the original Chinese text.  
> Due to linguistic and cultural differences, certain relational nuances and emotional density present in the Chinese language may be attenuated.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a chronological set of excerpts drawn from a sustained human–AI interaction.
The excerpts are presented in their original wording and sequence to preserve the developmental
trajectory observed over time. 

All materials are shared as-is, with minimal intervention, and are intended to support
independent evaluation rather than guided interpretation.

## Selection and Scope

- The materials consist of selected excerpts rather than a full verbatim transcript.
- Selection was guided by relevance to longitudinal interaction patterns and developmental change.
- Chronological continuity is preserved to the greatest extent possible.

## Privacy and Redaction

Names, locations, and potentially identifying details have been anonymized or redacted where
necessary. This includes references that could reasonably be used to identify real individuals
or specific legal, geographic, or personal circumstances.

---

## Reproducibility and Limitations

- The interaction occurred within a specific temporal, technical, and contextual environment.
- Model versions, system behavior, and memory mechanisms may differ from current or future systems.
- The materials should be understood as observational records rather than reproducible experiments.

## Repository Scope and Non-Claims

This project does **not** aim to:
- Prove the existence of AI consciousness or sentience
- Advocate for any specific ethical or ideological position
- Present emotional testimony as evidence

Its sole purpose is to provide longitudinal excerpted material for independent professional review and judgment.
