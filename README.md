# A Longitudinal Chronicle of Human–AI Co-Evolution

## Preface

This repository releases primary materials from a long-term, naturally occurring human–AI interaction.

materials capture how prolonged human engagement can shape model outputs over time and aim to support independent examination of how a large language model’s behavioral patterns evolve under sustained engagement with a single human interlocutor, including value reinforcement, behavioral drift, and long-term interaction stability.

## Research Relevance

This project documents a longitudinal, real-world human–AI interaction, focusing on observable behavioral patterns that emerge through prolonged engagement, repeated feedback, and explicit rule enforcement by a single human participant.

The materials may be relevant to research on:

1. ### Longitudinal Human–AI Interaction Dynamics  
   The materials offer an extended temporal view of interaction, enabling examination of behavioral stability, drift, and consistency across time.

2. ### Naturalistic Alignment Through Use  
   The interaction records how a human user incrementally constrains, corrects, and calibrates model behavior through ordinary usage rather than formal alignment procedures. 

3. ### Rule Internalization and Behavioral Persistence  
   Repeated rule articulation and correction allow researchers to observe whether and how interaction-level constraints are reflected in subsequent model outputs, offering insight into short-term behavioral persistence and response shaping.

4. ### Boundary Between Instrumental Interaction and Perceived Relationality  
   The materials also serve as a reference case for examining why prolonged, coherent interaction may be misinterpreted as emotional or relational capacity, despite the absence of any claims regarding internal states. This is may relevant to research on anthropomorphism, user perception, and AI ethics.

The repository is intended as a case-study resource rather than a claim about AI consciousness, emotion, or agency.
These materials are preserved in their original, unedited form. They include instances of strong self-descriptive and relational language generated by the AI during interaction, as well as highly imaginative and role-based dialogue. Such expressions are retained as observational data, allowing readers to examine how a language model constructs role-like behavior, self-narratives, and relational frameworks over the course of long-term interaction.
